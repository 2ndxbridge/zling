zling
=====

**fast and lightweight compression utility.**

zling (zlite-ng) is an improved compression utility, based on [zlite](https://github.com/richox/zlite).

zling shares the same entropy encoder with zlite, but uses an order-1 ROLZ, instead of zlite's order-3 one. and output index is encoded independently with another Polar table plus some extra bits.

in practice, zling compresses better and a bit slower than zlite, but decompresses faster.
